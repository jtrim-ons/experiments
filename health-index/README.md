The Python script in this directory converts the beta Health Index CSV to JSON-stat format.

The source CSV is based on the final sheet of https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/datasets/healthindexengland with changed column names.

You can explore the JSON-stat file in the [JSON-stat Explorer](https://jsonstat.com/explorer/#/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fjtrim-ons%2Fexperiments%2Fmain%2Fhealth-index%2Fhibeta.json) and [Observable](https://observablehq.com/@jtrim-ons/json-stat-for-the-health-index).
